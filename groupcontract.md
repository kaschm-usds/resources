# Group Contract

**What this is**: A template for a 'Group Contract', a document to be filled in by a team that is kicking off a project. Mostly I use this in the software development domain, but I suppose it could be used elsewhere as well! There is usually a second half of this document that is specific to the project itself (Goals / Risks / Timelines). 

**Motivation for Use**: I use this template, especially with teams of new people, to set a solid foundation of shared team and project goals. I find that this template drives important conversations and decisions early, so that the team isn't mired in confusion after the project is already underway. 

## Project Goals
### Facilitator: [Name]
_I usually facilitate the first few sections as a model, and then let others jump in if they want to facilitate._

- [Goal] 
- [Goal] 

_I give people ~5min each to write out their goals. Ideally, we are using a collaborative platform like Google Docs so everyone can be in the document at the same time. We then group the goals and walk through them, focusing on anything that isn't clear. I ask people to explain the items they have written so that there is a sense of ownership and collaboration._

## Group Norms
### Facilitator: [Name]
- Participation - _Any information regarding schedules - allocation %s, travel, etc_
- Tools - _Which tools will we use for collaboration, communication, roadmapping, designs, sharing files, remote participation, etc_
- Communication Norms - _Responding to calendar invitations, adding Hangouts to meeting invites, weekly meetings, vacation responders in email, sprint plannings, demos, etc_ 
- Process & Documentation - _How and when will we document our work? This can also apply to documentation in the code, for technical projects._ 
- Decision Making & Managing Conflict - _How will the team make decisions (technical, planning, resource allocation), and what happens if there is a tie or a conflict? What is the path of escalation? Who is the appropriate HR contact, in case of any issues on the team that cannot be resolved internally?_ 

## Group Roles & Skill-sets
### Facilitator: [Name]
- [Role] - [Person] 

_For this section, we generally identify the roles as a group, and then people volunteer to take on those roles (or we have a rotating position). Beyond 'official' roles, this part provides a great opportunity to identify the kinds of 'extra' roles that people may take on, and agree on ways to avoid implicit gender or other biases (for example, note-taking often falls to female colleagues). Examples of roles include: stakeholder management, resource management, engineering, product owner, design, QA, as well as 'extra' roles such as: note-taking, facilitating, scheduling, arranging team outings, etc._
